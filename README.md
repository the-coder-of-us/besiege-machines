# Besiege Machines Information Doc
Hello! I just recently started playing Besiege, and I've made a plethora of machines. So I'm posting all of my saved machines here and in steam workshop. So, I'm going to post every machine and the "Instructions for best use." All of my machines were used to complete a campaign level, so yeah. I will continue to add more as I complete them.
# Warning for those wanting to download my machines on GitHub...
IF YOU DO NOT SEE ANY MACHINES, WAIT TWO DAYS. Sometimes, the machines will not load. "Sometimes" should only be one times. And it's a problem on my end if that happens.

 # Check out my other projects! If any, yet...
Currently, there are a few things I'm working on, so here are my projects:

Ultra Custom Night HTML5 Port   Importance - 1

Undertale Fangame     Importance - 3

Computer Virus Escape game. It will not give you a real virus, but you have to solve puzzles to get rid of a virus on computers. It's kinda like you do a bunch of virus puzzles on a bunch of different computers around the world.    Importance - 4
